It involves assessing key factors such as material balance, piece activity, king safety, pawn structure, and control of critical squares. For example, even if the material is equal, a well-coordinated attack on the opponent’s king or control of an open file can give one side a significant edge. The ability to evaluate positions accurately is what separates strong players from those who rely solely on calculation.",

For instance, a dynamic advantage might involve sacrificing material to exploit a weak king position, while a static advantage might involve maneuvering to exploit an isolated pawn over time.",
