        "panelText": "Zugzwang is a state in which any move you make only worsens your position. Even if you would prefer to “pass” and maintain your current setup, you must move, and that forced action often hands your opponent the key to progress. This concept commonly occurs in endgames, where the position is finely balanced. If you have everything ideally placed, being compelled to shift a pawn or a piece can open the door for your opponent to break through or create decisive threats. Zugzwang highlights the importance of timing, harmony, and the fragile equilibrium that can define critical positions.",
