It’s not just about making individual moves but understanding how they connect to achieve a larger goal. For example, in an endgame with a passed pawn, your plan might involve advancing the pawn while simultaneously preventing your opponent’s counterplay. Good planning ensures your moves have purpose and direction, reducing the risk of aimless play.",
